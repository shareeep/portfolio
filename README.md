## About This Project

This site showcases my journey as a passionate software developer from Singapore. I'm enthusiastic about building robust backend systems and architecting scalable solutions. Here you'll find my projects, skills, and ways to connect.

Key interests and focus areas reflected in this portfolio:
- Sharpening Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) and LeetCode skills.
- Expanding backend expertise with Java & Spring Boot, aiming towards Solutions Architect roles.
- Keen to collaborate on impactful projects, especially Hackathons for Social Good and innovative AI Projects.
- Leveraging AI tools like Cline with Gemini 2.5Pro for AI-assisted development.
- Discussing Docker, Microservices, AI Automations/Chatbots, Backend Development, or System Architecture.
- Fun fact: Transitioned from the advertising industry, now building creative solutions hands-on!

## Project Tag System

This portfolio features a comprehensive tag system to help recruiters and visitors quickly identify the technologies and skills showcased in each project:

### Tag Categories

Tags are organized into three main categories:

- **Scope/Domain**: Frontend, Backend, AI/ML, UI/UX, Cloud, Security, etc.
- **Tools/Technologies**: React, Vue.js, Flask, PostgreSQL, Docker, AWS, etc.
- **Work Focus**: Web Application, Digital Transformation, Solution Architecture, etc.

### Filtering Capabilities

The projects page features a tabbed interface that lets visitors:

- Filter projects by scope, tools, or work focus
- See active filters with easy removal options
- Find projects that match specific technical requirements

### Home Page Display

The home page shows representative tags from each category with color coding:
- Blue for Scope/Domain tags
- Green for Tools/Technologies tags
- Purple for Work Focus tags

### Adding Tags to Projects

Tags are defined in each project's MDX frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: "Project Title"
# other frontmatter fields...
tags: ["Frontend", "React", "Web Application"]
---
```

The tag categorization system automatically sorts these tags into the appropriate categories.
