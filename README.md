Key interests and focus areas reflected in this portfolio:
- Sharpening Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) and LeetCode skills.
- Expanding backend expertise with Java & Spring Boot, aiming towards Solutions Architect roles.
- Keen to collaborate on impactful projects, especially Hackathons for Social Good and innovative AI Projects.
- Leveraging AI tools like Cline with Gemini 2.5Pro for AI-assisted development.
- Discussing Docker, Microservices, AI Automations/Chatbots, Backend Development, or System Architecture.
- Fun fact: Transitioned from the advertising industry, now building creative solutions hands-on!
