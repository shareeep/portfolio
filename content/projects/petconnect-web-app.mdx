### Project Overview

Problem statement: Pet owners often struggle to find opportunities for their pets to interact with others, especially for new pet owners who have not found a community. 

In Singapore, where pet ownership is rising, the limited pet-friendly spaces and events leave both pets and owners feeling isolated. Without regular socialisation, pets are prone to anxiety and behavioural issues, adding stress for owners. 

By fostering a community for both pets and their owners, we can ease this isolation and help pets thrive through connection.

Solution: PetConnect aims to help owners find events, organise playdates and connect with others in their community, ensuring their pets stay active, engaged and socially fulfilled!

#### Features
- **PetPost:** A dynamic homepage featuring a feed of pet-related posts from all users, creating a vibrant hub for pet lovers to connect and share.
- **Events:** A dedicated page showcasing both large-scale and casual events, helping users discover and participate in community gatherings or small meet-ups. Google Maps API was integrated for ease of location filtering.
- **Calendar:** A personalized calendar that tracks events users have signed up for, helping them stay organized and never miss an occasion.
- **Friends:** A streamlined page for managing friendships, where users can view friend requests, keep track of their friends, and receive tailored friend suggestions.
- **Profile:** A comprehensive profile page summarizing all user activities, including personal posts, joined or created events, and a showcase of their pets. 
- **Chats:** A real-time chat feature that allows users to connect and share content, such as posts or events, directly with friends for a more interactive experience.
