# Phisherman’s Friend

> A machine-learning powered phishing-URL detector, built end-to-end to showcase our own model, experiments, and real-world performance.

## 🐟 Project Motivation

Phishing remains one of the most prevalent social-engineering attacks on the internet. Even savvy users can be fooled by URLs that mimic legitimate sites.  
**Phishermen’s Friend** was born from the need to:  
- Automatically distinguish phishing from benign URLs in real time  
- Leverage custom feature engineering to improve detection  
- Demonstrate a full ML workflow—from data prep to evaluation and deployment

---

## 🔍 Data & Feature Engineering

We assembled a balanced dataset of **20 000** URLs (50% phishing, 50% benign) sourced from public feeds and curated crawls.

| Feature Category    | Examples                                |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **Lexical**         | URL length, number of ‘-’ or ‘@’ signs  |
| **Host-based**      | Age of domain, HTTPS usage              |
| **Content-based**   | Frequency of suspicious tokens (e.g. “login,” “verify”) |

## 🤖 Model Architecture

We experimented with two core models:

1. **Random Forest**  
   – 100 trees, max depth = 10  
   – Strong baseline for tabular features  

2. **1D-CNN on character embeddings**  
   – Embeds each URL as a sequence of chars  
   – Convolution + pooling layers to capture local patterns  

Finally, we combined them via a **voting ensemble**, boosting robustness.

## 📊 Evaluation & Results

| Metric            | Random Forest | CNN    | Ensemble |
|-------------------|---------------|--------|----------|
| **Accuracy**      | 96.5%         | 94.8%  | **97.2%**|
| **Precision**     | 95.9%         | 93.5%  | **96.7%**|
| **Recall**        | 97.0%         | 96.2%  | **97.8%**|
| **F₁ Score**      | 96.4%         | 94.8%  | **97.2%**|

## 🚀 Real-World Demo

We used a Google Colab Notebook to train and test our model.

- Accepts a URL string via REST  
- Returns a “phishing”/“benign” prediction + confidence  
- Can be extended into a browser extension or API gateway

## ✨ Key Learnings

- **Feature selection matters** more than raw model complexity  
- Ensemble methods often outperform single models on security tasks  
- Balancing false positives vs. false negatives is crucial in phishing detection  

*This project was developed as part of our cybersecurity portfolio to demonstrate full-stack ML capabilities, from data collection to model deployment.*
