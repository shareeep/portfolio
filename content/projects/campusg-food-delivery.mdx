### Saga Orchestrators

---

#### 1. Create Order Saga (Flask/Kafka)

Coordinates the order creation flow through Kafka events, interfacing with Order, User, and Payment services, and communicating with the Timer Service via HTTP. Handles compensation actions for failures.

| Step | Action                                                                                  |
|------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | Customer places order                                                                   |
| 2    | Saga coordinates order creation                                                         |
| 3    | Retrieves user payment info                                                             |
| 4    | Authorizes payment via Stripe                                                           |
| 5    | Updates order status                                                                    |
| 6    | Starts timer (Outsystems)                                                               |
| 7    | Handles failures with compensation (e.g., cancels order if payment fails)               |

    className="rounded-lg shadow-md"
  />
</div>

#### 2. Accept Order Saga (Temporal)

Manages the runner order acceptance workflow using Temporal activities to update the Order Service and Timer Service, with compensation logic for failures.

| Step | Action                                                                                  |
|------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | Runner accepts order                                                                    |
| 2    | Saga updates order status (assigns runner)                                              |
| 3    | Notifies Timer Service (Outsystems)                                                     |
| 4    | Handles failures with compensation (e.g., reverts order status)                         |

    className="rounded-lg shadow-md"
  />
</div>

#### 3. Complete Order Saga (Temporal)

Orchestrates order completion and payment flows, coordinating between Order, User, and Payment services, and managing fund release to runners via Stripe. Handles failure scenarios with compensation actions.

| Step | Action                                                                                  |
|------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | Runner marks order as completed                                                         |
| 2    | Saga updates order status                                                               |
| 3    | Retrieves runner payment info                                                           |
| 4    | Retrieves payment ID                                                                    |
| 5    | Releases funds (Stripe payout)                                                          |
| 6    | Updates final order status                                                              |
| 7    | Handles failures with compensation (e.g., reverts payout/status)                        |

<div className="flex justify-center my-8">

    alt="CampusG Complete Order Saga microservices interaction diagram & temporal workflow execution"
    className="rounded-lg shadow-md"
  />
</div>

#### 4. Order Timeout Process

Handles automatic order expiration and cancellation if not accepted within a set time frame.

| Step | Action                                                                                  |
|------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | Timer Service polls every 5 minutes to check if 30 minutes have passed since order creation. |
| 2    | If expired, marks the order as expired.                                                 |
| 3    | Create Order Saga polls every 1 minute for expired orders.                              |
| 4    | If found, initiates order cancellation via Kafka.                                       |
| 5    | Order Service processes cancellation and confirms via Kafka event.                      |

## Why Saga?

While planning the project, we discovered a post from AWS on the Saga Orchestration Pattern.

<div className="flex justify-center my-8">
  <Image
    src="/images/projects/campusg-aws-diagram.png"
    width="800"
    height="450"
    alt="AWS Saga Orchestration Step Functions Diagram"
    className="rounded-lg shadow-md"
  />
</div>

[Link to diagram from the AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/cloud-design-patterns/saga-orchestration.html#saga-orchestration-implementation)


In fact, this diagram that closely resembled the steps our services would need to go through, as it involved an ordering process where issues could occur across multiple services with various data states to manage.

Additioanlly, as most of the team lacked Java experience, we sought Python-based tools to assist with this implementation. We initially used a Pub-Sub system with Kafka to implement one of our Sagas (orchestration via Saga but with choreography-style execution). Later, we discovered a orchestration tool called Temporal and implemented two additional Sagas with it, more closely resembling the AWS Step Functions diagram.

We opted against AWS Step Functions as we were building our solution to run locally, and developing a fully cloud-hosted solution seemed daunting at that point.

The Saga pattern helped us manage complex distributed transactions like order creation, acceptance, and completion/payment. Without it, we would have needed to account for numerous edge cases and engineer multiple flows to handle all types of errors.


## Further Improvements

To further enhance our project, several real-world development considerations could be incorporated. For example, introducing an API gateway for our APIs and microservices would provide a unified entry point, enabling advanced features such as rate limiting, API versioning, and secure, permission-based access control.

Implementing an API gateway would have deepened our understanding of these core concepts. While we explored the fundamental capabilities of API gateways in class, integrating one into our project was considered Beyond-the-Lab (BTL) and thus not included in the initial scope.

Additionally, deploying the application to the cloud would enable a live demonstration accessible to all users. This would require further expertise in cloud deployment of microservices, as well as integration with cloud-based message brokers and saga orchestrators.
