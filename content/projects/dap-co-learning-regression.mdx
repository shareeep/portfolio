As part of the DAP co-learning series, I designed and facilitated a sharing on Gradient Descent in linear regression, to help peers build a strong shared foundation before moving into advanced topics.

To make the concepts easier to absorb, I built custom Gemini Canvas mini-apps and paired them with structured slides. The session focused on one crucial idea: reducing loss iteratively.

I used a coherent linear regression example with just two parameters: slope and bias, to clearly show how model updates improve fit over time. This made the mechanics of gradient-based learning more intuitive and created a solid base for future topics such as neural networks.

I delivered the workshop to 40+ mentees in an interactive format. The preparation and delivery were strengthened through mentorship from senior DAP team members with strong data science and AI expertise.
