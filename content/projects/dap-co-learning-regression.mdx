## Overview

As part of the DAP co-learning series, I designed and facilitated a regression-focused workshop aimed at helping peers move from theory to practical modeling decisions.

To make concepts easier to internalize, I built custom Gemini Canvas mini-apps that demonstrated key ideas in a hands-on, visual format. I also prepared structured slides to clearly explain evaluation metrics, feature engineering choices, and model trade-offs for real-world datasets.

The session was delivered to a cohort of 40+ mentees and emphasized engagement, discussion, and practical extension work. Throughout the preparation and delivery process, I was mentored by senior DAP team members with strong data science and AI backgrounds.
