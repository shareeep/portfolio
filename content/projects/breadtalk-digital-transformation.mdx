## Summary
This project explores a potential pathway for the digital transformation of BreadTalk, one of Singapore's leading bakery chains, through AI-driven solutions aimed at improving customer experience, streamlining operations, and enhancing business intelligence.

The goal is to address operational inefficiencies and modernise customer experience at BreadTalk using **data-driven solutions**. We noted three potential avenues to explore:
- Reducing checkout queue time
- Offering personalised recommendations based on user data
- Modernising BreadTalk's in-store and mobile experiences

We proposed three solutions that work together to create a cohesive experience for customers, modernising the brand's experience and creating rich data collection for BreadTalk to engineer & derive further insights. 
1. BreadPickUp — Mobile Order for Pickup
2. BreadSee — AI-Powered Mobile Checkout
3. BreadThink — Personalised Recommendations

### 1. BreadPickUp — Mobile Order for Pickup

</div>


This feature allows users to pre-order their bread via the app and pick it up in-store.
- Reduces wait time & ensures product availability
- Provides a convenient and speedy solution for rushing Singaporeans

Highly feasible, learning from competitors such as Luckin Coffee and Starbucks which have:
- Strong sales promotions: Such elements incentivise app usage
- Loyalty points system: Reducing friction at checkout and rewarding repeat purchases
- In-app pre-ordering: Appealing to convenience

### 2. BreadSee — AI-Powered Mobile Checkout

<div className="flex justify-center my-8">

    alt="User flow for breadsee function"
    className="rounded-lg shadow-md"
  />
</div>

We trained a computer vision system that identifies bread items on a tray for instant mobile payment.
- YOLOv11s model trained on 6 bread classes
- Eliminates manual checkout and minimises human error
- Provides customer insights - enables data collection on purchasing habits

The training process: 
- We labelled 324 images of BreadTalk bread that we purchased in various lighting (but consistently on a white tray of sorts). This was done manually in LabelStudio with our bread classes specified so that we can use it to train the YOLOv11s model.

| Class | TP | FP | FN | Precision (P) | Recall (R) | F1-Score |
|-------|----|----|----|--------------:|------------|----------|
| Coffi-O | 0.95 | 0.05 | 0.05 | 0.95 | 0.95 | 0.95 |
| Flosss | 1.00 | 0.00 | 0.00 | 1.00 | 1.00 | 1.00 |

| Sugar Donut | 0.83 | 0.17 | 0.05 | 0.94 | 0.88 | 0.91 |
| Overall (Macro Average) | - | - | - | **0.91** | **0.85** | **0.88** |

We also had a working live demo during our presentation where we had a webcam plugged in to our laptop as a camera source, and it successfully identified the breads we placed on the tray.

### 3. BreadThink — Personalised Recommendations

We also worked on a recommender system using the AutoRec Model to:

- Offer data-driven promotions and suggestions
- Improve customer loyalty
- Increase average basket size

Technical Process:
<div className="flex justify-center my-8">
  <Image
    src="/images/projects/breadtalk-autorec.png"
    width="800"
    height="450"
    alt="training and labelling for model training"
    className="rounded-lg shadow-md"
  />
</div>

Why AutoRec:
- AutoRec is a neural collaborative filtering approach that uses auto-encoders to generate personalised recommendations
- Autorec compresses the purchase history into a compact representation, then expands this to predict which new items that the user will enjoy.
- It works efficiently with sparse data by focusing only on items user actually purchased.

This is an example of the output derived from generated sample data of customers, passed through our trained model:
| user_id | purchase_history                          | rec_1_bread_name    | rec_1_confidence | rec_2_bread_name       | rec_2_confidence | rec_3_bread_name    | rec_3_confidence |
